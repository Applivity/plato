# Plato — Complete Decision Log

Produced by a structured grilling interview (questions Q1–Q22). Founder =
Umair (GitHub `ukhan`, umair1808@gmail.com). "Delegated" means the founder
explicitly left the decision to the assistant, which decided with recorded
reasoning. Nothing is silently assumed.

## Foundations

**D01 — Product (Q1, Q2).** Build an AI coding agent like Claude Code /
Copilot / Goose: company is Applivity (applivity.com), working name Plato.
Goal: a releaseable, usable MVP. Start small, enhance incrementally.

**D02 — Effort model (Q16).** Full-time solo founder, code written
end-to-end with AI assistance, ASAP pace. Consequence: use mainstream,
heavily documented tech (AI generation reliability), and make every
milestone end in something runnable and demoable.

**D03 — Language (Q9, delegated).** TypeScript. Research basis: Cline
(TS: VS Code ext + CLI + SDK), Goose (Rust: desktop + CLI), Aider (Python:
CLI only), all Apache-2.0, all using user-supplied provider keys. TS wins
because the extension host is natively JS/TS, one language covers
extension + future CLI over a shared core, and Cline proves the pattern.
Rust rejected (optimizes CLI-first distribution — phase two concern);
Python rejected (no extension story).

**D04 — Form factor (Q9, delegated).** VS Code extension first; CLI wraps
the same core later. Reasons: multi-agent supervision needs rich visible
UI (timelines, panes, approvals) which terminals show badly; marketplace
gives one-click install; core stays a UI-agnostic library either way.
Founder accepted; treated as settled unless vetoed (none came).

## Capability scope

**D05 — Tool loop (Q4).** Option (b): read file, write file, apply-diff,
shell, list/search files, git status/diff. Diff-based editing separates
"usable" from "toy"; whole-file rewrites are slow and clobber code.

**D06 — MCP (Q14).** Option (b): built-in tools + MCP stdio client reading
user-configured servers from `mcp.yaml`; tool permissions slot into team
profiles. Self-discovery/self-configuration of tools explicitly excluded
from v0.1 (v2 candidate).

**D07 — Providers (Q5).** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (covers OpenAI,
OpenRouter, Ollama, self-hosted) plus Anthropic native. User-provided API
keys only, stored exclusively in VS Code SecretStorage.

**D08 — Modes (Q6, A6).** `plan` (read-only), `edit` (file diffs, no
shell), `act` (per-action approval), `auto` (autonomous with hard caps).
Approval defaults: reads auto-approved; writes and shell commands approved
once per session; YOLO available as `auto`.

**D09 — Sessions (Q15, delegated).** No resume in v0.1. Events persist to
disk anyway (they power the cost meter, observer feed, debugging), so
browsable transcripts come free. True resume is a context-management
project, deliberately out of scope.

**D10 — Live supervision (Q10, A10).** Option (b): the observer receives
every coder tool call as an event-stream subscription and can send
messages injected into the coder's context, up to pausing it.
Reviewer-at-end becomes an observer with interrupt rights; the architect's
plan is the pipeline's *starting event*. Technically rides the same event
bus as the approval system. Verified gap: competitors coordinate only at
task boundaries.

**D11 — Team definition (Q11, A11).** Option (b) plus presets:
`.aplivity/teams.yaml` at repo level, global fallback
`~/.applivity/teams.yaml`; profile = {name, role prompt, model, allowed
tools, permissions}. Convenience solved with a shipped JSON schema bound
via VS Code `jsonValidation` (autocomplete, hover docs, red squiggles) +
copy-paste preset files. Root cause analysis of the founder's continue.dev
pain: silent invalid config, not config files themselves. Visual editor
deferred (would consume 30–40% of UI work for zero core value). Flag:
renaming the directory to `.plato/` is cheap any time before M3.

**D12 — Solo = team-of-one (Q13).** Everything is a team; a solo agent is
a team config with one profile. One code path, no dual engines.

**D13 — Flat teams (A10 scope).** v0.1 has no agent spawning agents.

**D14 — Cost governance (Q12).** Option (c): per-profile model mapping
(cheap model observes, strong model codes), hard budget cap per run in USD
or tokens with graceful wind-down, max concurrency limit, per-team turn
limits, live per-agent cost meter. Basis: Anthropic reports token spend
explained ~95% of multi-agent performance variance. Nothing hidden from
the user.

## Ground truth and identity

**D15 — Acceptance test (Q8, Q19, A19).** See BLUEPRINT section 4.
Proving ground: `/Users/ai/Desktop/HcadPublicAndroid-demo` — founder's
real Android project (Groovy DSL Gradle, `app` module, `gradlew`).
Implications: Java/Gradle handling must be first-class; secret-bearing
files (`keystore.properties`, `local.properties`) and `.gitignore`d files
must never enter model context.

**D16 — Name (Q17, Q18).** Plato, suggested by the founder. Legal
position: nothing legally required while building privately; USPTO/EUIPO
trademark sweep is a pre-release checklist item; domains are optional.

**D17 — Namespaces (facts, verified).** GitHub org `applivity-com`;
marketplace publisher `applivity` (verified live; extension ID
`applivity.plato`); publisher `applivityllc` also registered, kept parked
as alias (publisher IDs are permanent and cannot be renamed); npm org
`applivity`.

## Engineering strategy

**D18 — Repository (Q20).** Monorepo named `plato` under `applivity-com`:
pnpm workspaces + TypeScript project references; `packages/core`,
`packages/vscode`, `packages/cli` (later). Private until M4; license
decision at M4 (founder leans open source; Apache-2.0/MIT candidates).
Future devs can join without restructuring (add CODEOWNERS/review rules
then).

**D19 — Distribution reality (Q7, A7).** Repo stays private through MVP.
Marketplace publishing requires passing Microsoft review at first
release; both publisher accounts already exist.

**D20 — Handoff doctrine (A22).** All decisions live in-repo documents,
not chat history, so any developer or AI agent can continue the work
without the founder present. This file set is that doctrine.

## Open items carried forward

- Toolchain setup: RESOLVED (was "Node.js not installed") — Node v24.19.0
  via nvm 0.40.7 and pnpm 11.23.0 installed and verified; see HANDOFF
  prerequisites.
- Trademark sweep before public release (D16).
- License decision at M4 (D19).
- Optional rename `.aplivity/` → `.plato/` before M3 (D11 flag).
- Correction (verified during setup): GitHub account `applivity-com` is a
  personal user account, not an Organization. Repo target URL unchanged:
  github.com/applivity-com/plato. Automation tokens need the `repo`
  scope for repo creation and push.
